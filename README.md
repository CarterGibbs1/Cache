# Cache
This was a CS321 project. The professor asked us to implement a 2-level Cache using a Linked-List.
To compile the program through the command line. Download all dependencies and, from the directory with the files, run:

$ javac Test.java

To run the program through the command line, run:

  For a one level Cache:
    $ java Test 1 <cache size> <input textfile name>
  For a two level Cache:
    $ java Test 2 <1st-level cache size> <2nd-level cache size> <input textfile name>
